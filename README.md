# Cafe API

A Flask App driven RESTful API that allows the user to perform CRUD
operations to the database. Python Bootcamp Day 66

## Usage

This Flask app uses WTForms and SQLAlchemy to create a database where users can
locate cafes with various amenities such as wifi, bathrooms, plugins, etc.

Through the API, users can find all, specific or random locations as well as
update the price of coffee and delete a location if it's no longer in business.

The API documentation is published [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4095488/UVXjHamw)

If you don't want to use WTForms, you would swap out the language in the `/add`
route for a basic HTML form.
